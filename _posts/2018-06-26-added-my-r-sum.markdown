Finally I have added my résumé to this website. I had already created an existing résumé via LaTeX. It was written with `moderncv`-Class, and what should I say. It looks awesome. As you can see, the [Résumé](/resume)-links content looks somethings like similar to LaTeXs moderncv output. After some research I had found a Github [repository](https://github.com/barraq/pandoc-moderncv), which connects the power of `pandoc` with `moderncv`. It is a very nice tool for writing a résumé, that outputs to html. After some adjusments to the CSS, I was able to import the whole generated static html résumé into this jekyll site et voilá.

I have already got in touch with `pandoc` some time ago. I wrote my while bachelor thesis with `pandoc`. My conclusion of using Markdown to write a scientific thesis is not very amusing. I have ended up using more LaTeX-Code than I planned to. Maybe I will make a blog post about that later on.
